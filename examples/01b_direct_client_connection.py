"""
Demonstrates a client connecting directly to an independently running
pyvider-rpcplugin server using a known transport path (e.g., Unix socket).

This contrasts with examples that use `plugin_client` to launch the server.
To run this example:
1. Start a compatible server first (e.g., `examples/00_dummy_server.py` configured for Unix socket).
   Example: `python examples/00_dummy_server.py`
   (Ensure it's configured with PLUGIN_AUTO_MTLS=False or certs are set up if True)
   Note the Unix socket path it prints (e.g., /tmp/pyvider-XXXX.sock)
2. Update `SOCKET_PATH` in this script to match the server's socket path.
3. Run this script: `python examples/01b_direct_client_connection.py`
