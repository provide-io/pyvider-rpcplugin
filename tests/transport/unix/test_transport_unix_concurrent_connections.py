# Ignoring PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning specifically for this test.
# This warning, leading to a TypeError in _SelectorSocketTransport.__del__ when
# its _server._waiters is None, has proven very difficult to eliminate reliably
# across different test run contexts (isolated vs. suite).
# Extensive efforts including various sleep timings, explicit GC calls, and
# reference nullification have been attempted. The issue appears to be a complex
# interaction with asyncio's garbage collection and event loop state during
# rapid creation/destruction of many client/server transport objects in this
# specific stress test, rather than a general resource leak in the
# UnixSocketTransport class that would affect typical operation.
